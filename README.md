### E-Commerce and Retail B2B Case Study  

**Problem Statement:**  
Schuster, a global sports goods and accessories retailer, operates on a credit basis with hundreds of vendors. However, many vendors fail to adhere to credit terms, leading to late payments. Although Schuster imposes heavy late payment fees, this approach is not sustainable for maintaining long-term business relationships. Additionally, employees spend significant time following up with vendors, resulting in wasted time, non-value-added activities, and financial losses. To address these challenges, Schuster aims to analyze customer payment behavior and predict the likelihood of late payments for open invoices.  

**Payment Process at Schuster:**  
When a transaction occurs, Schuster's accounting team generates an invoice containing details about the goods, invoice value, creation date, and payment due date as per the contract's credit terms. Since transactions with vendors happen frequently, each vendor usually has multiple invoices at any given time.  

**Business Objectives:**  
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Categorize customers based on their payment behavior.  
2. **Prediction of Delayed Payments:** Use historical data to predict the likelihood of late payments for upcoming transactions where due dates are yet to be crossed.  
3. **Improved Operations:** Enable better resource allocation, faster credit recovery, and minimize low-value tasks through accurate predictions.
